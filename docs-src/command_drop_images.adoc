== Command: Drag and Drop Images

This one is slightly convoluted.
You can drag an image file into ST4, but it only results in opening a new tab to view the image.
You cannot target an already open tab.
It would be nice if you could drag it to a particular cursor position within an AsciiDoc file and have it directly result in an `image:[]` macro call, but you can't.
So the compromise is this:

. Drag one or more images to ST4. ST4 will open them each in their own tab.

. Navigate back to the tab with your AsciiDoc file and place your cursor where you would like the (first) `image:[]` macro call to appear.

. Invoke the "`Links: Gather Dropped Images`" command via "`Tools > AsciiDoc`" menu.
This will create one `image:[]` macro call for each of the image tabs.
It will also close the image tabs as it does.

. Edit the file paths as desired.

. Move the secondary calls to where they belong.
