[[static-toc]]
== Static Table of Contents

The "`AsciiDoc: Static Table of Contents`" command is used to create a static (i.e. a current snapshot) ToC in the form of an unordered list corresponding to every heading in the current document.
If a heading is preceded by an anchor, then the bullet item will be a link; otherwise, plain text.
Also, if the first line of text that follows a heading is a byline (i.e. starts with "by ") then that line will be added to the end of the heading text.
The ToC is inserted at the top of the edit buffer.

Here is an example without anchors:

----
= The Title of This Book

by Someone U. Know

== Introduction

Lorim Ipsum

== Getting Started

Lorim Ipsum

=== First Steps

Lorim Ipsum

=== Next Steps

Lorim Ipsum
----

Becomes:

----
* The Title of This Book by Someone U. Know
** Introduction
** Getting Started
*** First Steps
*** Next Steps
----

And here is an example with anchors:

----
[[title]]
= The Title of This Book

by Someone U. Know

[[intro]]
== Introduction

Lorim Ipsum

[[getting-started]]
== Getting Started

Lorim Ipsum

=== First Steps

Lorim Ipsum

=== Next Steps

Lorim Ipsum
----

Becomes:

----
* <title,The Title of This Book> by Someone U. Know
** <intro,Introduction>
** <getting-started,Getting Started>
*** First Steps
*** Next Steps
