== Snippet Details

"`Snippets`" in Sublime Text are also known as "`live templates.`"
A snippet is inserted by typing the trigger word followed by the `tab` key.
For example, type ##char## `tab` to start a new character sheet.
Sublime will then guide you through the template, filling in the blanks.
In some cases, blanks are automatically computed based on the entries of corresponding blanks.
Hit `tab` to navigate from one blank to the next.


=== Story-Writing "Murder Board" Template

##murder## `tab`-- A 140-line template for describing the story overall.

=== Character Sheet

##char## `tab`-- A 40-line template for describing a (main) character -- either added to the murder board, or kept in a separate file.

=== Location Sheet

##place## `tab`-- A 20-line template for describing a key location -- either added to the murder board, or kept in a separate file.

=== Scene Card

##scene## `tab`-- A 15-line template for outlining the arc of a single scene (sequence).

=== Story Element

##elem## `tab`-- A 5-part template for specifying the placeholder for a particular story element that will be fleshed out later.
This is based on the concept of "`outlining via Matryoshka`" as described in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWufOLC34jg[].
The analogy here is that the elements (3x5 _cards_) of an outline are like Russian Matryoshka (nesting dolls).
A card/doll can represent a _character_, a _setting_, an _object_, or an _event_.


=== Anchored Subsection

##[[## `tab`-- Sets up the entry of a subsection header that is preceeded by an anchor where the anchor's ID is automatically generated based on the text of the title.
The anchor ID is guaranteed to be lower case without spaces.
